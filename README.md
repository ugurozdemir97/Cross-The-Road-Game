A very simple game where you try to cross the road full of cars as a turtle. The cars density and speed will increase as you level up. Just run "Cross The Road.py" to play the game. 

The cars created were stacking on the left side of the screen and since there is no no garbage collection or removing items in "turtle" package, if you run the game long enough it was using too much ram. So I found the solution to create limited amount of car turtles and rotating them outside the screen. So there is actually a race track but only see a small portion of the road :D
